# marky
 A lightweight js Markdown compliler 

 **THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS, DONT TRUST THIS SHITZ**

 See a working example here: <https://rockoontechnologies.github.io/marky/index>


 To get started, just steal the "marky.js" script or use `<script src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RockoonTechnologies/marky/main/marky.js"></script>`
 
 Then call the `stringParser(your string)` it will return pretty html- works with multiple lines.
 
 Consult the example for a usage examplar
